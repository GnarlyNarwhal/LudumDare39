## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Must have [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed
* NOTE: I run Java 8 so I cannot guarantee that it will work on earlier version, but I don't believe I've used anything preventing it from running on some older versions. Click [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) to download Java 8.

Graphics driver must have support for OpenGL 3.3 Core or later

### What's this all about?
This project is my game for Ludum Dare 39. If you don't know what [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/about) is and you're into making games then definitely check it out [here](https://ldjam.com/about).

### So what's the game?
Well the game is a game in which you, the player, must control a system of mirrors to direct a laser to the target. You do this by writing programs that control the mirrors and the laser cannons. The game is very short and has some maybe game breaking bugs, but overall its fairly complete. 

### Can I play it?
Of course! Here's how:

Click [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B30vfj3rcantWWxEcHRZZnRWREE) to download the game. Once you've downloaded it just run the jar file.

Of course you can always download the source and compile it yourself. You are going to need [LWJGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org/download). Make sure to include JOML under **Addons**
